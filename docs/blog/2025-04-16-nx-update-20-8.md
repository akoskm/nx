Time for another Nx update! Let's dive into what's new in Nx 20.8 since our [last release post for 20.5](/blog/nx-update-20-5).

## Rspack Support for Angular

One of the most exciting features in this release is the addition of Rspack bundler support for Angular applications. You can now use the `--bundler=rspack` option when generating new Angular applications:

```shell
nx g @nx/angular:app my-app --bundler=rspack
```

This option is also available in the Angular stack when using `create-nx-workspace`:

```shell
npx create-nx-workspace@latest my-workspace --preset=angular --bundler=rspack
```

The Rspack bundler option provides significant performance improvements over the traditional webpack bundler, while maintaining compatibility with your existing Angular applications.

## Enhanced HTTP-based Caching

Nx 20.8 introduces support for HTTP-based caches, expanding our caching capabilities beyond traditional file-based and cloud-based solutions. This feature allows you to leverage HTTP endpoints for storing and retrieving your build artifacts, providing more flexibility in how you manage your cache infrastructure.

This enhancement is particularly useful for teams that:

- Want to implement custom caching solutions
- Need to integrate with existing HTTP-based caching systems
- Require more control over their cache storage and retrieval mechanisms

## Storybook 8 Support

We've updated our Storybook integration to support the latest Storybook 8 version. This brings all the new features and improvements from Storybook 8 to your Nx workspace, including:

- Enhanced performance
- Improved component development experience
- Latest security updates

## Improved Release Versioning

The release versioning implementation has been revamped to provide more flexibility and control over your versioning strategy. This update makes it easier to:

- Handle complex versioning scenarios
- Manage dependencies between packages
- Implement custom versioning logic

## Crystal Support for Module Federation

For teams using Module Federation, we've added Crystal support for both host and remote applications. This enhancement improves the development experience when working with microfrontends in your Nx workspace.

## Testing Improvements

### Cypress 14 Support

We've added support for Cypress 14, ensuring you can use the latest features and improvements from the Cypress testing framework in your Nx workspace.

### Jest Configuration Updates

The testing configuration has been updated to enforce CommonJS modules for ts-jest, ensuring better compatibility and reliability in your test environment.

## Core Improvements

Several core improvements have been made to enhance the overall development experience:

- **Lock File Handling**: Improved handling of yarn resolutions and patches when parsing and pruning lock files
- **Project Configuration**: Added support for globs in project config to extend atomized targets
- **Git Integration**: Enhanced filtering for git checkouts in generated pipelines and documentation

## Bug Fixes and Quality of Life Improvements

This release includes numerous bug fixes and quality of life improvements:

- Fixed webpack and rspack builds to properly respect the output.clean config option
- Updated resolution of TypeScript path mappings
- Improved handling of subpath patterns in package exports
- Enhanced error logging for ProjectConfigurationsError
- Fixed focus command functionality in the dependency graph
